_Download and version info:_
- Download (Therefore agreeing to the [EULA](http://aviacreations.com/legion/): [Legion (v0.18)](<link>))
- Game version: "R5pc_r5launch_J1624a_CL394493_2019_02_24_09_29_PM"
- Game SHA1: "ed4c5f6770881dc4dda2514fa5c43928ebeca181"

## Usage:
Using Legion is fairly simple as the tool only requires the files located within "Apex\paks\Win64" in order to function.
> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the Win64 folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

- The tool supports Drag and Drop functionality, supported file formats are ONLY the **.rpak** extensions.
> **IMPORTANT:** The tool only supports the base game; so, patch files such as "common(02).rpak" are currently **unsupported**.

## Ripping:
- The **.rpak** files contain various encoded assets that Legion can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are: .txtr (Texture), .dtbl (Data table)
  - .txtr are exported as textures in DDS format.
  - .dtbl are exported as a CSV file.

## Versioning:
- 0.18 - Initial Release.
