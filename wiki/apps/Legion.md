# Legion - The Apex Legends Asset Extractor
Extracts various assets from the Titanfall game "Apex Legends". This software is considered **Work-in-Progress** developed by [DTZxPorter](https://twitter.com/dtzxporter). The current release V0.18 is a **DEMO** of what the tool is going to be capable of. Porter is working on the tool on his spare time, if you'd like to see faster development or you'd just like to send your support to Porter for his work you can do so [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=686S5QL7Z4HKQ).

> **IMPORTANT:** By downloading this software you are agreeing to the **EULA** located inside of the archive (EULA.txt).

## Usage:
Using Legion is fairly simple as the tool only requires the files located within "Apex\paks\Win64" in order to function.
> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the Win64 folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

- The tool supports Drag and Drop functionality, supported file formats are ONLY the **.rpak** extensions.
> **IMPORTANT:** The tool only supports the base game; so, patch files such as "common(02).rpak" are currently **unsupported**.

## Ripping:
- The **.rpak** files contain various encoded assets that Legion can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are: .txtr (Texture), .dtbl (Data table)
  - .txtr are exported as textures in DDS format.
  - .dtbl are exported as a CSV file.

## Versioning:
- 0.18 - Initial Release.
